## Project Overview

Goal of this project is to practice data analysis skills. I chose to read in two data files (two Jane Austen novels) from project Gutenberg. I split them apart by their words, and then joined them, cleaned them, and performed some calculations on them based on questions of interest!

- User must set up virtual environment before installing necessary packages. 
    - User should do `Python3 -m venv venv`, then `source/venv/bin/activate`
